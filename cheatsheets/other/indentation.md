# Indentation

All my favorite languages and formats in one place.


## 2 spaces

- Ruby
- Bash
- JavaScript
    - Sometimes 4 spaces
    - Sometimes tabs.


## 4 spaces

- Python
    - Although some argue for tabs.
- Java
- Markdown
    - You can use 2 spaces, but in some cases around nesting bullet points you must use 4 spaces to get desired functionality.
    - Tabs also work, but less common.
    

## Tabs

- GraphQL
- Makefile
