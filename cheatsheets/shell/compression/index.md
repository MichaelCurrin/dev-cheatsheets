# Compression


<!-- Move to Learn to Code and then link to a shorter version here, maybe with tables -->


Command-line tools available for Unix-like systems (Linux and macOS):

- [zip utility]({% link cheatsheets/shell/compression/zip.md %})
- [tar utility]({% link cheatsheets/shell/compression/tar.md %})
- `gzip`
- `bzip2`

You can use `unzip` and `tar` on the file, though the `tar` syntax might be harder to remember.

The last two are not covered as commands in this guide.
