# Strings


## About

Everything is Unix systems is either a string (text stream) or binary data (like an image).

In Bash, there is no integer or boolean. Just strings. See also [Arrays][] and [Associative arrays][] cheatsheets.

Also if you want a special character to be a plain string, you must quote it. e.g. Using `>` vs `'>'`.

```console
$ echo >
zsh: parse error near `\n'
```
```console
$ echo '>'
>
```

## Quoting strings

### Single quotes

Use **single quotes** for a literal string that is not evaluated.

```sh
X='Hello, $(whoami) / $USER'

echo "$X"
```
```
Hello, Hello, $(whoami) / $USER'
```

### Double equotes

Use **double quotes** to evaluate.

```sh
X="Hello, $(whoami) / $USER!"

echo "$X"
```
```
Hello, mcurrin / mcurrin!
```


### No quotes

The expression will be evaluated.

```console
$ echo Hello
Hello
```

```console
$ echo Hello $USER / $(whoami)
Hello mcurrin / mcurrin
```
If the value is multiple words (separated by space or newline), then the value will be spread out.


## When to quote

Quotes are usually optional.

Sometimes they do make a difference.

### Empty values

Such as if a variable is empty.

This will cause a syntax error if `FOO` is not set or empty.

```sh
[ -z $FOO ]
```

This will be safe.

```sh
[ -z "$FOO" ]
```


### Words

If a variable multiple words, with a space or newlinws, but you want a single string.

Important for a file path with spaces.

OK:

```sh
$ cd "My Projects"
```

Error:

```sh
$ cd My Projects
```

The same goes for passing arguments using a variable.

```sh
$ TARGET="My Projects"
$ # OK
$ cd "$TARGET"

$ # Error because it sees `My` and `Projects` as two arguments.
$ cd $TARGET
```


Or a URL that has spaces in it. You can also use `%20` in place of spaces.


OK:

```sh
$ curl "https://example.com/My Projects"
$ curl "https://example.com/My%20Projects"
```

Error - this would pass two arguments.

```sh
$ curl https://example.com/My Projects
```

### Expanding paths

If you using a glob like `*` or the user directory like `~`, you probably want those outside of any quotes to avoid literal evaluate.

OK:

```sh
$ cd ~/Documents
```

Will give an error.

```sh
$ cd "~/Documents"
```

If you need quotes, use `$HOME`.

```sh
$ cd "$HOME/Documents"
```


### Multi-line strings

#### Using enter

Just press enter for a newline, in single or double quotes.

Nothing special is needed like in other languages to include multiple lines.

```sh
X='Hello,
world'

echo "$X"
```
```
Hello,
world
```

#### Using escaped newline character

You can also use `\n` for a newline. But you need to use `-e` flag to evaulate newlines (need in Bash but ZSH doesn't need the flag).

```sh
X="A\nB\nC"
echo -e "$X"
```
```
A
B
C
```

Or using `echo` directly:

```sh
echo "ABC\nDEF\nGHI"
```
```
ABC\nDEF\nGHI
```

With `-e` flag.

```sh
echo -e "ABC\nDEF\nGHI"
```
```
ABC
DEF
GHI
```

Using `printf`:

```sh
printf 'ABC\nDEF\nGHI\n'
```
```
ABC
DEF
GHI
```

Or `print`:

```sh
print 'ABC\nDEF\nGHI'
```
```
ABC
DEF
GHI
```

#### Wrap a long string without splitting over newlines

Use a backslash to go to the next line.

Make sure to use double quotes or not quotes.

```sh
$ echo "abcdef\
123456"
```
```
abcdef123456
```

Or

```sh
$ echo abcdef\
123456
```
```
abcdef123456
```

Single quotes will have a literal backslash:

```sh
$ echo 'abcdef\
> 123456'
abcdef\
123456
```

#### Skip first line

For indentation reason, you might want to leave text off of the first line. Use the `\` symbol to split your command so you start the string on the next line.

```sh
$ echo \
'First line
Second line'
```
```
First line
second line
```

### Escaping quotes

If you want to include quotation marks in your output.

```sh
echo "With 'single' quotes"
echo 'With "double" quotes'

echo 'With \'escaped single\' quotes'
echo "With \"escaped single\" quotes"
```

If you need to use single and double quotes in the same string and don't want to use `\` to escape them, then read on for _heredoc_ below.

### Defaults

Set a default value in case a variable is not set.

The syntax here is within `${}` substitution, as `${VARIABLE:-DEFAULT}`.

e.g.

No default supplied - result is empty string.

```console
$ echo "Hello, ${NAME}"
Hello,
```

With default/fallback set from string literal.

```console
$ echo "Hello, ${NAME:-World}"
Hello, World
$ NAME=developer echo "Hello, ${NAME:-World}"
Hello, developer
```

With default/fallback set from a variable.

```console
$ DEFAULT_NAME='World'
$ echo "Hello, ${NAME:-$DEFAULT_NAME}"
Hello, World
$ NAME=developer echo "Hello, ${NAME:-$DEFAULT_NAME}"
Hello, developer
```


## Heredoc strings

See [guide](https://linuxize.com/post/bash-heredoc/).

Bash supports a _heredoc_:

- This lets you create a string which implicitly escapes all single and double quotes, letting you write a clean string.
- Typically, a heredoc is used for writing multi-line strings, but you don't have it.
- You might use it for a literal string or evaluate expressions.

For most cases, I don't need a heredoc. A standard single or double-quoted string works well - including for multiple lines.

But, the heredoc does have the advantage that you can use single and double quotes inside the string without escaping them, as your string terminator will be `EOF` for example.

### Syntax

Note you can use anything, but `EOF` is the common term to start and end the shell heredoc.

The last occurence should be on a line of its own, without indentation and without characters after it.

In one situation, I found `EOF)` as the last line was actually valid in my shell, but in a CI flow I got a linting error.

### Evaluated string heredoc

```sh
cat << EOF
CONTENT
EOF
```

Example:

```sh
cat << EOF
Line 1
Line 2
You are $(whoami)
EOF
```

Output:

```
Line 1
Line 2
You are mcurrin
```

Works with `cat` but not `echo`.

You can use anything at the start and end, but `EOF` for "end of file" is the convention.

A heredoc allows a multi-line string with evaluation. Without having to explicitly escape quotes as `"\"user\": \"$(whoami)\""`.

Storing as a variable and formatting as a JSON string.

```sh
MY_VAR=$(cat << EOF
{
    "user": "$USER"
}
EOF
)

echo "Quoted"
echo "$MY_VAR"
echo "Unquoted"
echo $MY_VAR
```

```
Quoted
{
    "user": "mcurrin"
}
Unquoted
{ "user": "mcurrin" }
```

Note double quotes on `echo` to keep newlines.

Example - note escaped backticks to prevent executation.

```sh
cat << EOF > README.md
## My heading

\`\`\`
$ git clone $REMOTE_URL --branch mybranch && ./$REPO_NAME/script
\`\`\`
EOF
```

### Literal heredoc

Prevent evaluation by using quotes (single or double).

```sh
cat << "EOF"
CONTENT
EOF
```

Example:

```sh
cat << "EOF"
Line 1
Line 2
You are $USER
EOF
```

Output:

```
Line 1
Line 2
You are $USE
```

Here, we store a value as a JSON string.

```sh
MY_VAR=$(cat << EOF
{
  "user": "$USER"
}
EOF
)
```

Printing quoted:

```console
$ echo "$MY_VAR"
{
  "user": "my-name"
}
```

Printing unquoted.

```console
$ echo $MY_VAR
{ "user": "my-name" }
```

### Indent

From [guide](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/bash-cookbook/0596526784/ch03s04.html)

The heredoc becomes more useful than a plain string when you use remove common indentation.

Here we indent the text with **tab** (not spaces) and then use `<<-` to remove tabs (does not remove spaces.

```sh
if true; then
	cat <<- EOF
	Line 1
	Line 2
	EOF
fi
```

Output:

```
Line 1
Line 2
```

Note that `EOF` must not be indented.

Or, with a variable.

```sh
VAR=$(cat <<- EOF
	{
		"user": "$(whoami)",
	}
EOF
)

echo "$VAR"
```

### Piping

```sh
cat << 'EOF' | sed 's/l/e/g'
Hello
world
EOF
```
Output:
```
Heeeo
wored
```

Write to file.

```sh
cat << 'EOF' |  sed 's/l/e/g' > file.txt
Hello
world
EOF
```

### Heredoc in other languages

#### PHP

Using a heredoc in PHP - from the [PHP manual](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.syntax.heredoc).

```php
$foo = 'abc;
$x = <<<EOT
Line 1
Line 2
'Single quotes' line.
"Double quotes" line.
$foo
EOT;
}
?>
```

#### JavaScript

In JavaScript, you would do use backticks. This will evaulate expressions though.

- `index.js` for JavaScript.
    ```javascript
    foo = 'abc';
    var x = `\
    Line 1
    Line 2
    'Single quotes' line.
    "Double quotes" line.
    ${foo}
    `
    ```

Note use of escaped newline at the start, to prevent first line from appearing as empty.

#### Python

In Python you would use three quotes. You could use double quotes (`"`) usually, just for convention. You would use an `f` string as below for evaluation.

- `app.py` for Python.
    ```python
    x = f"""\
    Line 1
    Line 2
    'Single quotes' line.
    "Double quotes" line.
    {foo}
    """
    ```

Note use of escaped newline at the start, to prevent first line from appearing as empty.


## Case

From [article](https://linuxhint.com/bash_lowercase_uppercase_strings/).

For Bash 4 and up only. Not Bash 3 or ZSH.

### Titlecase

```s
$ x='abc'

$ echo "${x^}
Abc
```

### Uppercase

```sh
$ x='abc'

$ echo "${x^^}
ABC
```

For Bash 3 - from [answer](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/51983/how-to-uppercase-the-command-line-argument).

```sh
$ MY_VALUE="Some string"
$ printf '%s\n' "$MY_VALUE" | awk '{ print toupper($0) }'
SOME STRING
```

### Selective uppercase

Here we uppercase only `p` and `j` letters.

```sh
$ LANGUAGES='python perl java php c#'
$ echo ${LANGUAGES^^[p,j]}
```

### Handle inputs

Apply titlecase to an input. e.g. `yes` becomes `Yes`.

```
read -p "Do you like music? " ans
answer=${ans^}
echo "Your answer is $answer."
```
