# Rename



## Notes

Be careful not use reserved variables like `PATH` otherwise things can break. Use `file`, `FILE`, `p` or `PATH`.

Be careful about globbing on hidden directories - as you can break `.git`.


## Change extension

The `find` command is probably more efficient and could let you run multiple commands, but using the `for` loop has more familiar syntax. There may be trade-offs for each when it comes to renaming (or moving) a directory, since it will affect future traversing steps in the same sequence. Using `find` might give more precision on the filename and type compared to using a `*` glob with `for` and having to use `if` statements in the loop to do checks.

### Using the find command

Note that the `find` command will work recursively by default.

Optionally add the `-depth` command. Note from the docs:

> `-depth` Process each directory's contents before the directory itself.  The -delete action also implies -depth.

You can omit `-name` and value. Note that the `*` glob is necessary there otherwise you'll get no results.

Here is the general form to search and perform an action. The part at the end is hard to remember but is needed. Additionally add `-type f` for just files.

```sh
$ find PATH -name SEARCH -exec bash -c 'COMMAND' '{}' \;
```

Renaming:

```sh
$ find . -exec bash -c 'mv "$1" "RULE"' - '{}' \;
```


[source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21985492/recursively-change-file-extensions-in-bash)

Rename `.foo` to `.bar`.

```sh
$ find . -name '*.foo' -exec bash -c 'mv "$1" "${1%.foo}".bar' - '{}' \;
```

[AskUbuntu](https://askubuntu.com/questions/35922/how-do-i-change-extension-of-multiple-files-recursively-from-the-command-line)

Replace underscores with dashes. To avoid `mv` errors on renaming a file to the same name as before, we only match on files with underscores in them.

```sh
$ find . -name '*_*' '-exec sh -c 'mv "$1" ${1//_/-}' - '{}' \;
```

You use the [rename tool](#rename-tool).

```sh
$ find . -name '*.foo' -exec rename 's/\.foo$/.bar/' '{}' \;
```


#### Preview

Print only. Use `echo` instead of moving.

You need `$0` instead of `$1`. And the hyphen at the end can be removed.

```sh
$ find . -name README.md -exec sh -c 'echo $0' '{}' \;
ci-cd/circle-ci/README.md
ci-cd/README.md
ci-cd/netlify/README.md
...
```

#### Git

In a `git` repo, you can use `git mv`:

```sh
$ find . -name "*.foo" -exec bash -c 'git mv "$1" "${1%.foo}".bar' - '{}' \;
```


### For loop

Use [globstar][] to get recursive globs (`**`) - only Bash 4+ or ZSH.

```sh
for file in PATH/**/*.foo; do
  mv "$file" "${file%.foo}.bar"
done
```

[howtogeek.com](https://www.howtogeek.com/423214/how-to-use-the-rename-command-on-linux/)

Here we replace extension `.foo` with `.bar` using a `for` loop:

```sh
for file in *.foo; do mv -- "$file" "${file%.foo}.bar"
```

Replace space with underscore in certain file types, using parameter expansion.

```sh
for P in *.doc *.mp3 *.wav *.txt; do
  mv -- "$P" "${P// /_}"
done
```

Note the replacement syntax is different to that of `sed`. (Also, the double dash will skip files that are unchanged I think. Or use `mv -i`?)

Here we rename `README.md` to `index.md` (rather than changing extension):

```sh
for P in **/README.md; do git mv -v "$P" "${P//README.md/index.md}"; done
```

Use `-n|--dry-run` flag to preview first (Linux only). Using the `-v|--verbose` flag is implied with that.

Replace an _underscore_ with a _dash_ in file and directory names - using [globstar][].

```sh
for P in **/*_*; do
  git mv --verbose "$P" "${P//_/-}"
done
```

Notes:

- This ignores hidden files. Important - ignore `.git`. Also note that files in `.github` like templates might only work using dashes.
- That will **ignore** the top-level, so be sure to run also for just `*_*`.
- That will give an **error** on directory paths which have an underscore in multiple levels, as it will try to name the same item multiple times in one run. So you have to run the command a second time to catch those. If you have two directory levels and a file inside all with underscores, you'll have to run the command 3 times, which is okay.
- The above can be followed by a search in the IDE with regex pattern. Note that cases should be checked before replacing. Pattern: `\w+_\w+\.md`


### Rename tool

Install the `rename` utility.

```sh
sudo apt install rename
```

Rename file extension for a batch of files.

```sh
rename 's/.foo/.bar/' *.foo
```
