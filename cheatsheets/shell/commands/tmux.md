Create an unnamed session.

```sh
$ tmux

```

Then you can exit with `exit` or <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> to end the session.

Or press this sequence to detach from the session and keep it running: <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> and then <kbd>D</kbd>,

List sessions:

```sh
$ tmux ls
```

e.g. Unnamed session:

```
0: 1 windows (created Thu Apr 28 18:34:12 2022)
```

e.g. Named session:

```
test: 1 windows (created Thu Apr 28 18:26:26 2022)

From within Tmux, you can also list all sessions and switch between them: <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> then <kbd>S</kbd>.

You can cycle through sessions with left and right brackets: <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> then <kbd>)</kbd>.
