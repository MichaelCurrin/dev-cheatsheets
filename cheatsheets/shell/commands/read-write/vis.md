NAME
     vis -- display non-printable characters in a visual format

SYNOPSIS
     vis [-cbflnostw] [-F foldwidth] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The vis utility is a filter for converting non-printable characters into a visual representation.
     It differs from `cat -v' in that the form is unique and invertible.  By default, all non-graphic
     characters except space, tab, and newline are encoded.  A detailed description of the various
     visual formats is given in vis(3).
