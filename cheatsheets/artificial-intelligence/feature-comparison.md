Notes:

- These are covering free tier features. They have limitations such as for ChatGPT it will switch to _GTP-4o mini_ after limited _GPT-4o_ interactions. While Claude stops working completely for a few hours. Gemini lets you upgrade to get more advanced features and models.
- ChatGPT has a [Download](https://openai.com/chatgpt/download/) page for mobile and desktop apps.
- ChatGPT can connect ot Google Drive and OneDrive with the "+" plus options. Gemini can pick up Google Drive automatically or you can use the "@" mention for Google Drive.
- To test search the web, you can ask for the weather (realtime info).

For plugins and extensions:

- ChatGPT allows you to use GPTs published by others and to make your own (on premium).
- Gemini allows you to interact with Google Drive, Google Maps, YouTube, flight bookings, and more.
- Bing had plugins before like generating music but this seems to be removed.
