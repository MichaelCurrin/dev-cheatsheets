## Links

- [pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai/) - includes image generator and samples (including Python with `pollinations` or `requests` or with a React frontend). Their website looks unprofessional like they use AI to generate text on the site (including logos with typos half the time and even their Terms and Conditions page is AI-generated).
- [Repo on GitHub](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations)
- [React Hooks](https://react-hooks.pollinations.ai/) interactive tool for generating images.
