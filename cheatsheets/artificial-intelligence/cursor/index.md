An AI-focused IDE for creating and updating code, tab auto-completion, and for chats with persistent history.

Here is an example of using code editing to apply changes inline:

## Usage tips

### Chat

Applying code changes directly can be limiting without a conversation first and without getting an explanation out. So use the chat pane to ask to have a conversation and then ask for changes, then apply them.

### @ mentions

Use the "@" symbol either in the code writing/editing or in the chat, so you can reference with objects like specific files or classes.

### Codebase reference

In that chat, use the option to reference the whole base rather than the current file (this will be more expensive but can give you a better solution by understanding multiple files and the suggestions can be across files).

### Scope of changes

When getting code changes, apply for the whole while or just specific lines.

### Comments

You can write code comments for your requirements before you have code or a function name without a body, then use the tab auto-completion to complete your code.

Even if you don't use AI to fill out the comments, you can fill it in yourself manually or come back to it another day or share with someone else. 

### Add to edit

If you start code changes with _Edit_, you can find code in other files and add them to the context with _Add to edit_.

I haven't figured out the use of this yet.
