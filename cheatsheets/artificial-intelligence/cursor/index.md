An AI-focused IDE for creating and updating code, tab auto-completion, and for chats with persistent history.

## Usage tips

- Use the "@" symbol either in the code writing/editing or in the chat, so you can reference with objects like specific files or classes.  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0c7d336-6248-4d5e-8d5a-72bf2e46ed71)

- In that chat, use the option to reference the whole base rather than the current file (this will be more expensive but can give you a better solution by understanding multiple files and the suggestions can be across files). ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1d2b340-d77d-444d-b0ca-78f4705b70ef)
- When getting code changes, apply for the whole while or just specific lines. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21d3b346-a726-4fba-b5bb-a469afa31185)
- Applying code changes directly can be limiting without a conversation first and without getting an explanation out. So use the chat pane to ask to have a conversation and then ask for changes, then apply them. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0ce9311-16b4-473e-bea8-3aab6c0c8fd4) ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fac2d4f-7d6f-4fec-a232-6bb4b90cbed6)
- You can write code comments for your requirements before you have code or a function name without a body, then use the tab auto-completion to complete your code.
- If you start code changes with _Edit_, you can find code in other files and add them to the context with _Add to edit_. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/941bb1ac-7e07-4efa-b97f-128b81f2183d)
