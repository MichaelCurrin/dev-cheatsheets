# Types

Use like `@click`. Or chain events and modifiers as in other cheatsheet pages.


## Common event types

Event name | Description
---        | ---
`click` | When the element is clicked
`input` | Fires when user changes an input value.
`change` | Fires when user changes the value and unfocusses input (for example, clicked somewhere outside)
`keyup` | listen for keyboard events.

There are a lot more. Use VS Code and a Vue extension and it will suggest all values when adding `@` to an element.
