## Element

From [Rendering Elements](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html) tutorial.

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;

ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
```


## Component approaches

### Functional component

The modern, easier-to-test way that uses functions. 

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, { props.name }</h1>;
}
```

See the [Props][] cheatsheet for alternative ways of handling properties.

To handle state, you can use [React Hooks][] or a state library. This makes is easier think about and layer components.

Use `onInput` for text inputs.

Use `onChange` for a checkbox or radio button.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function Welcome() {
  const [ value, setValue ] = useState("my default value");
  
  const onInput = (event) => {
    setValue(event.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <input
        id="value-input"
        onInput={ onInput }
      />
      
      <br />
      <br />
      
      <div>{ value }</div>
    </>
  );
}
```

You can also set `value` variable as the `input` tag's `value` attribute. So that when the page loads (or refreshes), you can fill the text box with the user's value (persisted from state like maybe localStorage).

```jsx
<input
  id="value-input"
  value={ value }
  onInput={ onInput }
/>
```

Setting the value as above does't matter so much when you use `onInput`.

If you use `onSubmit` to set the value then you'll find that you actually **cannot** edit the value in the text input because you have fixed it to match a variable. So then you'll want to **remove** the value bit.

```jsx
<input
  id="value-input"
  onSubmit={ onSubmit }
/>
```

### Class component

The older, more verbose way. Using a class and `this` (which can be confusing and works differently to other languages)

```jsx
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, { this.props.name }</h1>;
  }
}
```

See documentation on [React.Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html).

A more complex example with state. Manage state using `this.state` and `this.setState`.

```jsx
import React from "react";

export default class Foo extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      // 
    };
  }

  onClick() {
    this.setState(currentState => ({
      // ...
    }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <>
        <input
          id="value-input"
          value={ value }
          onChange={ onChange }
        />
        <br />
        <br />
        <div>{ value }</div>
      </>
    );
  }
}
```


## Choosing an approach

See blog post [Functional vs Class-Components in React](https://medium.com/@Zwenza/functional-vs-class-components-in-react-231e3fbd7108)

> If you need a **state** in your component you will either need to create a **class** component or you lift the state up to the **parent** component and **pass** it down the functional component via props.

Though that advice may be outdated, since with React Hooks you can add state to a functional component.

Reasons to use functional components:

> 1. Functional component are much easier to read and test because they are plain JavaScript functions without state or lifecycle-hooks.
> 2. You end up with less code.
> 3. They help you to use best practices. It will get easier to separate container and presentational components because you need to think more about your component's state if you donâ€™t have access to `setState()` in your component.
> 4. The React team mentioned that there may be a performance boost for functional component in future React versions.

Another reason against class components is that [Classes confuse both people and machines](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html#classes-confuse-both-people-and-machines) (React docs section on Hooks release).
