title: Hooks
description: Manage state in React components
---

Hooks were added in React 16.8 and let you use state and lifecycle methods in a functional component, where before you had to use a class component.

Note that hooks must be used in functions and not nested within each other. You cannot add a `useState` hook within a `useEffect` hook.
