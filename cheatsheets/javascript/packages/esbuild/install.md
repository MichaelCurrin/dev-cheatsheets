# Install

Install globally or in your project packages.

```sh
$ npm install esbuild # --global
```

Or invoke with `npx` - which will do a fresh download for you each time. It goes quickly and allows you to leave esbuild out of dev dependencies list.

```sh
$ npx esbuild --help
```

The website also supplies instructions for building from source with Go. 

Or you can download a pre-built binary from NPM. See [Download a build](https://esbuild.github.io/getting-started/#download-a-build). This is useful is you don't have Node installed but still have JS files to process like for a frontend-based focused tool or a Deno app.
