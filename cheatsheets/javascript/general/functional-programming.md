# Functional Programming

What you'll use.

- Currying.
- Composite functions.
- Map, filter, reduce.
- Function call chaining.
- Passing around functions as objects.
- Lazy evaluation.


## Lodash

- [lodash.com/](https://lodash.com/)

> Lodash makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle out of working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc. Lodashâ€™s modular methods are great for:

- Iterating arrays, objects, & strings
- Manipulating & testing values
- Creating composite functions
    
```javascript
// FP build for immutable auto-curried iteratee-first data-last methods.
const fp = require('lodash/fp');

const curryN = require('lodash/fp/curryN');
```
