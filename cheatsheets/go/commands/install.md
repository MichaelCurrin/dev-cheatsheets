# install


## Usage

```
usage: go install [-i] [build flags] [packages]
Run 'go help install' for details.
```


## Help

```
go help install
usage: go install [-i] [build flags] [packages]

Install compiles and installs the packages named by the import paths.

Executables are installed in the directory named by the GOBIN environment
variable, which defaults to $GOPATH/bin or $HOME/go/bin if the GOPATH
environment variable is not set. Executables in $GOROOT
are installed in $GOROOT/bin or $GOTOOLDIR instead of $GOBIN.

When module-aware mode is disabled, other packages are installed in the
directory $GOPATH/pkg/$GOOS_$GOARCH. When module-aware mode is enabled,
other packages are built and cached but not installed.

The -i flag installs the dependencies of the named packages as well.

For more about the build flags, see 'go help build'.
For more about specifying packages, see 'go help packages'.

## Basic

This will compile the app and add it to your `GOBIN` directory, so you can run it anywhere.

### No module given

Given module `main.go` and no arguments, the current directory's name will be used (such as the repo name). This does not the script name or the script's directory.

```sh
$ go install
```

The result will be:

- `main.go`
- `~/go/bin/my-repo`

If there is no Go script at the top-level, you'll get an error.

### Module given

Both of these give the same output name.

```sh
$ go install main.go
$ go install cmd/myapp/main.go
```

Result:

- `main.go` or `cmd/myapp/main.go`
- `~/go/bin/main`

I don't know a more precise way of doing this where the package name is kept.

### URL given

To install a Go module by URL, rather use the `go get` command.

If you run this just anywhere, it will fail:

```go
$ go install github.com/MichaelCurrin/go-project-template
```

But, if you run it inside that directory, it will work because of the `go.mod` file definition.

```sh
$ cd go-project-template
$ go install github.com/MichaelCurrin/go-project-template
```

Though, you might as well just do this, which seems equivalent.

```sh
$ cd go-project-template
$ go install
```


## Verbose

> print the names of packages as they are compiled.

```sh
$ go install -v
```
