# Registry

## GitHub

If using GitHub, a URL will be like one of these.

```
github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME
github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME/PATH
```

### Go package registry

See [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev])

The [gopkg.org](https://gopkg.org/) site is under construction. 

For example see CLI at [pkg.go.dev/github.com/urfave/cli](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/urfave/cli).

That links to GitHub - [urfave/cli](https://github.com/urfave/cli).

Though someone could link to anywhere. Sometimes organizations use their own domain to host.

Multiple packages can share a repo.

e.g. ` github.com/gohugoio/hugo/tpl` and `github.com/gohugoio/hugo/docshelper ` are listed as Go packages and are in the same [https://gohugoio/hugo](github.com/gohugoio/hugo) repo.
