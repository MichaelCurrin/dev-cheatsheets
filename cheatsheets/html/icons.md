This guide covers inserting HTML icons in webpages, focussing on _FontAwesome_.

## Example

```html
Solid: <i class="fas fa-clock"></i>
Regular: <i class="far fa-clock"></i>
```

## Setup

Follow install instructions below so your icons will render. If you use a website theme, these may be included already such as with [https://github.com/jekyll-octopod/jekyll-bulma](https://github.com/jekyll-octopod/jekyll-bulma) which uses FontAwesome4.
