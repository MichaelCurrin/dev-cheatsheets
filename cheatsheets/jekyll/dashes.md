# Dashes

When using [Kramdown](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown) in Jekyll and maybe others, you can write an en dash of em dash using plain hyphens.

You can escape this conversion by using code formatting.

Examples below

- en dash
    - `A -- B`
    - A -- B
- em dash
    - `A --- B`
    - A --- B
