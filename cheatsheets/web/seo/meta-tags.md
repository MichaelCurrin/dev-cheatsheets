## Title

Length: 20 to 70 characters

From Woorank:

> Since they are one of the most important on-page SEO elements you should make your title tags between 20 and 70 characters including spaces (200 - 569 pixels). Make sure each page has a unique title and use your most important keywords. For internal pages start your title tags with your most important keyword(s).

## Description

Length: 70 to 160 characters

From Woorank:

> Meta descriptions allow you to influence how your web pages are described and displayed in search results. A good description acts as a potential organic advertisement and encourages the viewer to click through to your site.
>
> Keep it short and to the point; the ideal meta description should contain between 70 and 160 characters - spaces included (600 - 940 pixels).
>
> Ensure that each of your web pages have a unique, straightforward meta description that contains most important keywords. These keywords are especially important because they appear in bold when they match the userâ€™s search query (See the Google Preview below).
>
> Check your Google Search Console (Search Appearance > HTML Improvements) for any warning messages to identify meta descriptions that are too long/short or duplicated across more than one page.


## Keywords

Example:

```html
<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">
```

Note that Google **ignores** this tag and only uses content.

Source: [Google does not use the keywords meta tag in web ranking](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2009/09/google-does-not-use-keywords-meta-tag.html) post on Google Blog site.

Google does also give more weighting to bold and italics words.


## Robots

From [docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta/name#other_metadata_names).

> `robots`: the behavior that cooperative crawlers, or "robots", should use with the page.
> 
> It is a comma-separated list of the values below: 

- `index`
- `noindex`
- `follow`
- ...

e.g.

```html
<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">
```
