### Type

`og:type`

- Defaults to `website` if not set, though this could be set explicitly to avoid SEO tool errors.
- There can only be one.
- See [Types](https://ogp.me/#types) reference. This covers articles, music, videos, etc.

### Image


`og:image`

- URL for the image.
- > To update an image after it's been published, use a new URL for the new image. Images are cached based on the URL and won't be updated unless the URL changes.
