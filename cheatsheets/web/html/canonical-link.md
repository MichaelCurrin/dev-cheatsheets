# Canonical link

When there is a risk of duplicate content across your pages, websites, or your cross-post on a blog and your own website, you can use this metatag to tell a search engine crawler which page is "preferred".

```html
<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/my-page/" />
```

See [article](https://yoast.com/rel-canonical/).
