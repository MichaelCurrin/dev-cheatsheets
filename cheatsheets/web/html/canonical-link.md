# Canonical link

## Syntax

```html
<link rel="canonical" href="URL" />
```

e.g.

```html
<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/my-page/" />
```


## Why

When there is a risk of duplicate content across your pages, websites, or your cross-post on a blog and your own website, you can use this metatag to tell a search engine crawler which page is "preferred".

If you do not set this field, then a crawler will prefer the _first_ page it sees and conside all the rest duplicates and _not_ show them in search results.

Setting this is useful if you have users forking your repo and setting up their own sites, but you want your "original" site to be the one search engines prefer.
