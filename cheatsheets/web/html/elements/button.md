## Resources

- [Button tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_button.asp) on W3 Schools.



## Basic

```html
<button>
    My text
</button>
```


When you hover over the button, the cursor will change to `pointer`. The same for `a` tags. No CSS needed.

If you omit the type, then the default is set as `type="button"`.


## Reset

Useful to reset a form to defaults or empty.

```html
<button type="reset">
    Reset
</button>
```


## Submit

Useful to submit a form to the same page or an endpoint.

```html
<button type="submit">
    Submit
</button>
```


## Disabled

Make the button not clickable. It will also appear faded.

```html
<button disabled>
    My text
</button>
```
