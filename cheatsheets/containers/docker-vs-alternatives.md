# Docker vs alternatives

## Docker pricing and licenses

See [Docker Pricing](https://www.docker.com/pricing/) for plans.

> Docker licensing is always free for personal use. But what if your team or business wants to use Docker? Compare our pricing options and features.

See [Docker Desktop License Agreement](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/desktop-license/) on pricing and terms.

So for business use, Podman and Colima are good alternatives. They also have other benefits.

## Comparision

| Feature | **Docker** | **Podman** | **Colima** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Concept** | Standardized container platform | Linux native, rootless, secure | Lightweight VM for macOS & Linux |
| **Licensing** | Commercial license for Docker Desktop in large enterprises; free for personal use and small businesses. | **Open-source** (Apache 2.0). Completely free for all uses, including commercial. | **Open-source** (MIT license). It leverages the open-source Docker Engine, avoiding Docker Desktop's commercial license. |
| **Architecture** | Client-server daemon (Docker uses a central daemon for a client-server model) | Daemonless (Podman is a daemonless engine that runs containers as user processes) | Wrapper for other runtimes (Colima is a lightweight VM manager that hosts a Docker or containerd engine for macOS and Linux) |
| **Security** | Runs as a root daemon; single point of failure. | **Rootless by default**; containers run as user processes, improving security. | Inherits security of the underlying runtime (usually Docker Engine), but a more minimal VM reduces attack surface (run as root but only inside the VM). |
| **Performance/Resources** | **Resource-heavy on Mac and Windows.** It runs a full Linux VM with a daemon and a GUI. This can consume significant CPU and RAM, even when idle. It has a "Resource Saver" mode, but the VM still has an overhead. | **Very lightweight and fast on Linux.** Because it's daemonless, it only uses resources when a command is executed. On macOS and Windows, it still requires a VM, but the overall footprint is often lighter than Docker Desktop. | **Extremely lightweight.** Colima's VM is a minimal Linux distribution (`Lima`). It has a significantly smaller memory and CPU footprint compared to Docker Desktop, resulting in faster startup times and less resource consumption, especially on macOS. |
| **User Experience** | All-in-one GUI for Mac/Windows, which is convenient but resource-heavy. | CLI-focused and Linux-native. Podman Desktop offers a GUI, but it's a separate install. | CLI-only, lightweight, and very fast. Integrates with the existing `docker` CLI, so there's no learning curve. |
| **Kubernetes Integration** | Built-in single-node Kubernetes via Docker Desktop. | Can manage "pods" natively and has strong Kubernetes-focused tools like `podman generate kube`. | Easily enables a local Kubernetes cluster (k3s) via a simple command line flag (`colima start --kubernetes`). |
| **Platform** | macOS, Linux, Windows | Linux native; macOS, Windows via a VM. | **macOS, Linux** |
| **CLI** | `docker ...` | `podman ...` (mostly Docker-compatible) | `colima ...` (manages the VM) + `docker ...` |
| **Docker Compose**| Built-in | Requires `podman-compose` or a `docker-compose` alias. | **Works out-of-the-box** by default. |

Here is a detailed comparison table focusing on security, performance, and other user-affecting features, with a focus on how each tool operates.

---

| **User Experience** | **All-in-one package.** Provides a comprehensive GUI for managing containers, images, and volumes. It also offers built-in Kubernetes and extensions. This makes it very user-friendly for beginners but can feel bloated for CLI-focused users. | **CLI-focused and Linux-native.** The core experience is on the command line. A GUI is available with **Podman Desktop**, but it's a separate install and not a core part of the package. | **CLI-only and minimalist.** It has no GUI; all interaction is through the command line. It's designed for users who are comfortable with the terminal and want a fast, simple experience. It integrates seamlessly with the standard `docker` CLI you already know. |
| **Network & Volumes** | **Seamless integration.** Handles port forwarding and volume mounts automatically, which "just works" out of the box for most scenarios. | **Requires configuration.** Port forwarding and volume mounts can be more complex, particularly with rootless networking. It often requires specific network setups (e.g., `slirp4netns`) to function correctly. | **Very good integration.** Colima provides excellent automatic port forwarding and volume mounts to the underlying VM, making the user experience feel very similar to Docker Desktop but with less overhead. |
| **Ecosystem & Community**| **The industry standard.** The largest community, most extensive documentation, and the most third-party tool integrations. It's the de facto choice for many teams and CI/CD pipelines. | **Growing rapidly.** Podman has strong backing from Red Hat and a very active community, especially in enterprise and security-conscious environments. The ecosystem is maturing quickly, with tools like `podman-compose` closing the feature gap with Docker. | **Niche but dedicated.** Colima is a much smaller project focused on a specific use case (lightweight dev on Mac/Linux). Its community is highly active on GitHub, and its development is rapid. It doesn't have the broad ecosystem of Docker or Podman but serves its purpose exceptionally well. |


## Explanations

#### Docker

Docker is the well-known, industry standard for containerization. It uses a **client-server architecture** where the `docker` CLI communicates with a background daemon (`dockerd`). This daemon manages all containers, images, and volumes. While powerful and feature-rich, its daemon-based approach and default root access can be a security concern. For macOS and Windows, Docker Desktop uses a **virtual machine (VM)** to run the Linux-based daemon.

#### Podman

Podman is a container engine designed to be a direct, daemonless replacement for Docker. Instead of a central daemon, it runs containers as direct child processes of the user. This means it can run **rootless containers** by default, which is a significant security advantage. 

It's a top choice for security-sensitive environments and for native Linux users, though on macOS and Windows it must still run inside a VM.

#### Colima

Colima is not a container engine itself but rather a simple command-line tool that sets up a lightweight Linux VM to run a container engine, typically **Docker Engine or containerd**. It's specifically designed for **macOS and Linux developers** as a more lightweight and resource-efficient alternative to Docker Desktop. It allows you to use your familiar `docker` commands but with a more performant and minimalist backend.
