# Docker vs Podman

### Docker vs. Podman Summary

| Feature | Docker | Podman |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Architecture** | Uses a **daemon** that runs as root. This is a client-server model where the daemon manages containers. | **Daemonless**. It runs containers directly as child processes of the user, eliminating the single point of failure. |
| **Security** | The daemon running as root is a potential security vulnerability. **Rootless mode is an option**, but not the default. | **Rootless by default**. This significantly reduces the attack surface as containers don't have root privileges on the host. |
| **User Experience** | Has a very mature ecosystem and a vast library of public images. The CLI is the industry standard. | The CLI is intentionally **very similar to Docker's**, making it an easy transition for existing users. |
| **Kubernetes Integration** | Docker has its own orchestration tool (**Docker Swarm**), but it's less compatible with the Kubernetes model. | Designed to be **Kubernetes-native**. It can manage pods and containers using the same concepts, making it a good choice for K8s users. |
| **Licensing** | Docker Desktop has a commercial license for large companies, leading many to seek open-source alternatives. | Fully open-source and free for all use cases. |
