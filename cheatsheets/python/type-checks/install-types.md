# Install types

Maybe this is a newer feature - I never ran into this before.

I got an error from Mypy on missing types.

These can be installed like this.


## Interactive

```sh
$	mypy --install-types --non-interactive
```

Then you have to enter <kbd>y</kbd> and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.


## Non-interactive

Or simply do this:

```sh
$	mypy --install-types --non-interactive
```
