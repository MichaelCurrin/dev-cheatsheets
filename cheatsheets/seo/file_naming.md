From Woorank:

> Using underscores in your URL makes it hard for search engines to determine your site's relevance to a search. Google sees hyphens as word separators while underscores are ignored. So the search engine sees https://thebuckfeverunderground.co.za/music/last_days_of_beautiful/ as all one word. Use hyphens in your URLs instead: https://thebuckfeverunderground.co.za/music/last-days-of-beautiful/.
> 
> We've detected underscores in your URLs. Change underscores to hyphens to maximize your SEO.


From [SEO Basics: Hyphen or Underscore for SEO URLs?](https://www.ecreativeim.com/blog/index.php/2011/03/30/seo-basics-hyphen-or-underscore-for-seo-urls/) blog post.

> The short answer is that you should use a hyphen for your SEO URLs. Google treats a hyphen as a word separator, but does not treat an underscore that way.
> 
> Google treats and underscore as a word joiner — so red_sneakers is the same as redsneakers to Google. This has been confirmed directly by Google themselves, including the fact that using dashes over underscores will have a (minor) ranking benefit.

> Matt Cutts stressed that the ranking difference between using dashes or underscores is minor — but then, that means there is a ranking difference.
