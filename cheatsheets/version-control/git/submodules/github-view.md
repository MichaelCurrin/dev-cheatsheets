# GitHub view

If you view a submodule on GitHub, you get a reference to the directory name and the commit.

e.g. 

In the [themes](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/hugo-quickstart/tree/master/themes) directory on my Hugo Quickstart, the submodule `ananke` is displayed in the GitHub UI as:

- `ananke @ 0cc2c6c` 

In the [themes](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/hexo-quickstart/tree/master/themes) directory of my Hexo Quickstart, the submodule `landscape` shows as 

- `landscape @ f20626c`
