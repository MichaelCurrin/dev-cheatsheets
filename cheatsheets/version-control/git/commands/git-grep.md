## Examples

Looks for `time_t` in all tracked `.c` and `.h` files in the working directory and its subdirectories.

```sh
$ git grep 'time_t' -- '*.[ch]'
```

Looks for a line that has #define and either MAX_PATH or PATH_MAX.

```sh
$ git grep -e '#define' --and \( -e MAX_PATH -e PATH_MAX \)
```

Looks for a line that has NODE or Unexpected in files that have lines that match both.

```sh
git grep --all-match -e NODE -e Unexpected
```

Looks for solution, excluding files in Documentation.

```sh
$ git grep solution -- :^Documentation
```
