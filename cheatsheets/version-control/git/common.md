# Common

## Notes

My commonly used commands for quick reference. Especially the command and flag combinations I **frequently** use or need to lookup or get confused with (e.g. do I use `-r` or `-v` on `git branch`, or was that `git remote` ?). Leaving out any which are already memorized or painfully obvious if you're not a beginner.

Ideally this can all fit on a page especially by leaving out explanations and output or putting them in compressed setions. There can be links to other sections for more variations, or details on that subcommand.

I can also move commands off this list to a memorized list.
