# GUIs


## Standard

Applications made by the makers of Git.

Make sure to run these inside a repo.

### Gitk

- [git-k](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk) docs.

```sh
$ gitk
```

### Git GUI

- [git-gui](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui) docs.

```sh
$ git-gui
```

### Installing

Install Git with Homebrew:

```sh
$ brew install git 
```

Then install `gitk` and `git-gui` using `git-gui` formula.

```sh
$ brew install git-gui
```


## Third party

- [GUI Clients](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) on the Git docs.
    > Git comes with built-in GUI tools for committing (`git-gui`) and browsing (`gitk`), but there are several third-party tools for users looking for platform-specific experience. 

e.g. 

- GitKraken
- GitHub Desktop
- GitUI
