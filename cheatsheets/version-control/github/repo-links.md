# Repo links

Without loading just the README file, you can load the repo with file list, with the READE focused in the view to avoid scrolling.


## README

The NPM package.json actually uses this.

```markdown
[link](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/cheatsheets#readme)
```

## Heading in README

```markdown
[link](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/dev-cheatsheets#dev-cheatsheets)
```


## Standard

Constrast the above with loading _just_ the README, without the files listed above.

```markdown
[link](/README.md)
```

Or

```markdown
[link](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/cheatsheets/blob/master/README.md)
```
