```

#### master

- [https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/cheatsheets/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/cheatsheets/archive/master.zip)

```sh

### Assets

### Latest release

Based on [GH docs - Linking to a Release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/linking-to-releases).

Download the latest release's assets:

```
/owner/name/releases/latest/download/asset-name.zip
```

I find that doesn't work for me.

e.g. this is invalid:

- [https://github.com/trashhalo/imgcat/releases/download/latest/checksums.txt](https://github.com/trashhalo/imgcat/releases/download/latest/checksums.txt)

But this works:

- [https://github.com/trashhalo/imgcat/releases/download/v1.2.0/checksums.txt](https://github.com/trashhalo/imgcat/releases/download/v1.2.0/checksums.txt)

Also the other assets on there have the tag name in filename, so you can't just do a generic way.

See assets here:

- [https://github.com/trashhalo/imgcat/releases/tag/v1.2.0](https://github.com/trashhalo/imgcat/releases/tag/v1.2.0)


## GitHub UI URLs

The examples here are using Go Project Template repo.

This has releases which contain both 

- source code of the repo at that tag point, as an archive (`.zip` and `.tar.gz`).
- assets generated by CI or attached manually. (`.tar.gz` containing binary executables)

### All releases

- [https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/go-project-template/releases/](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/go-project-template/releases/)

### Target release

- [https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/go-project-template/releases/tag/v0.4.0](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/go-project-template/releases/tag/v0.4.0)

Download binary:

- [https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/go-project-template/releases/download/v0.4.0/go_project_template_0.4.0_darwin.tar.gz](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/go-project-template/releases/download/v0.4.0/go_project_template_0.4.0_darwin.tar.gz)

Download tarball:

- [https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/go-project-template/archive/refs/tags/v0.4.0.tar.gz](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/go-project-template/archive/refs/tags/v0.4.0.tar.gz)

### Latest release

This only works if your have a release, not just pre-releases.

- [https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/code-cookbook/releases/latest](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/code-cookbook/releases/latest)

That redirects you to a page like:

- [https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/code-cookbook/releases/tag/v4.0.0](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/code-cookbook/releases/tag/v4.0.0)
