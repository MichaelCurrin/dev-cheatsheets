### Multiple repos

Get multiple repos for a user.

- [/users/MichaelCurrin/repos](https://api.github.com/users/MichaelCurrin/repos)

Note that there are also parameters like `limit` and `page` to set on repos, but these are not covered here.

```json5
{
    "id": 147400032,
    "node_id": "MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDc0MDAwMzI=",
    "name": "aggre-git",
    "full_name": "MichaelCurrin/aggre-git",
    "private": false,
    
    // ...
  },
  
  {
    // ...
  }
]
```

### Downloads

Docs: 

- [Download a repository archive (tar)](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#download-a-repository-archive-tar)

```
get /repos/{owner}/{repo}/tarball/{ref}
```


## Fields

Here are notes on fields of interest found on a repo.

### Tags

All tags:

- [/repos/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator/tags](https://api.github.com/repos/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator/tags)

You'll see a field like `"tag_name": "v2.0.0"`.

Note using `\` doesn't work for pipe `|`, but using brackets allows you to wrap across lines.

```console
$ (curl -s 'https://api.github.com/repos/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator/releases/latest' |
  grep '"tag_name":' | 
  sed -E 's/.*"([^"]+)".*/\1/')
v2.19.0
```

Testing on a simplified case:

```console
$ echo '"tag_name": "v2.0.0"' | grep '"tag_name":' | sed -E 's/.*"([^"]+)".*/\1/'
v2.0.0
```

I originally found this using `wget`, but that is unneccessary for handling text and not downloading a file.

```console
$ (wget -qO- 'https://api.github.com/repos/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator/releases/latest' | 
  grep '"tag_name":' | 
  sed -E 's/.*"([^"]+)".*/\1/')
v2.0.0
```

### Releases

You can't see all releases I don't think, but you can get target releases.

Latest release (does _not_ include those marked as "pre-release"):

- [/repos/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator/releases/latest](https://api.github.com/repos/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator/releases/latest)

Look up by ID e.g. `34552316`:

- [/repos/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator/releases/34552316](https://api.github.com/repos/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator/releases/34552316)

Sample response:

```json5
{
  "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator/releases/54486193",
  "assets_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator/releases/54486193/assets",
  // ...
  "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator/tarball/v2.19.0",
  "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator/zipball/v2.19.0",
  // ...
}
```

Note that if you use `latest`, that is just an alias to say `v2.19.0` and its matching ID, so your JSON repsonse will still have the actual tag number and ID in it.

### Homepage URL

Note that homepage field will use whatever is in the repo's URL section, not necessarily a GitHub Pages URL.

e.g.

```json
{
  "homepage": "https://artists-portfolio.netlify.app/"
}
```

Read `has_pages` to determine if GitHub Pages is active. Then you can figure out the URL programmatically.
