## Fields

Here are notes on fields of interest found on a repo.

### Tags and releases

All tags:

[/repos/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator/tags](https://api.github.com/repos/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator/tags)

All releases:

[/repos/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator/releases/](https://api.github.com/repos/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator/releases/)

You'll see a field like `"tag_name": "v2.0.0"`.

You can extract this with:

```sh
$ wget -qO- "https://api.github.com/repos/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator/releases/latest" | grep '"tag_name":' | sed -E 's/.*"([^"]+)".*/\1/';
v2.0.0

# Testing.
$ echo '"tag_name": "v2.0.0"' | grep '"tag_name":' | sed -E 's/.*"([^"]+)".*/\1/'
v2.0.0
```

Though you might as well use `curl` instead of `wget` if you aren't saving a file.

Latest release:

[/repos/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator/releases/latest](https://api.github.com/repos/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator/releases/latest)

A target release - you can look up a release by ID. e.g. `34552316`

[/repos/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator/releases/34552316](https://api.github.com/repos/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator/releases/34552316)

### Homepage URL

Note that homepage field will use whatever is in the repo's URL section, not necessarily a GitHub Pages URL.

e.g.

```json
{
  "homepage": "https://artists-portfolio.netlify.app/"
}
```

Read `has_pages` to determine if GitHub Pages is active. Then you can figure out the URL programmatically.
