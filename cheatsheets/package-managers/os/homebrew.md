## Install Homebrew

See the [brew.sh](https://brew.sh) homepage.

This will request your password as it needs _root_ permissions.

```sh
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

See [install.sh](https://github.com/Homebrew/install/blob/master/install.sh) on GitHub.

If upgrading Homebrew, it is recommended to then [upgrade all packages](#upgrade-all-packages).


## Update list

Update Homebrew's local list of packages.

This does _not_ actually update packages. Note you probably _don't_ need to use this, since an update is done before commands like install.

```sh
$ brew update
```


## Install packages

If a package is _already_ installed and you install it again, you'll get an error message telling you to upgrade it instead.

### Install selected package

Install a specific package by its formula.

_Note: Unlike `apt`, the `update` command is done internally to get the latest remote info - [#1670](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/1670)._

```sh
$ brew install PACKAGE
$ brew install PACKAGE@VERSION
```
e.g.

```sh
$ brew install gcc@7 python@3.9
```

**Warning**: The default behavior is for the `install` command to automatically **upgrade all installed packages**. This has caused issues for me where Python environments broke when upgrading something unrelated to Python.

Install without auto-upgrade - from [article](https://computingforgeeks.com/prevent-homebrew-auto-update-on-macos/).

```sh
$ HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1 brew install PACKAGE
```

Or set once-off in `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` so it is always set.

```sh
export HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1
```

### Install a cask

See also [Homebrew casks](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/).

```sh
$ brew cask install CASK_NAME
```


## Upgrade packages

### Outdated

List outdated packages - including current and latest versions.

```sh
$ brew outdated
```

### Upgrade selected package

```sh
$ brew upgrade PACKAGE
```

Warning: This will also upgrade dependents.

e.g. Upgrading `shfmt` upgraded these too:

```
...
==> Upgrading shfmt 2.6.4 -> 3.3.0
...
==> Upgrading 14 dependents:
cython 0.29.21 -> 0.29.23, gnutls 3.6.15 -> 3.6.16, httpie 2.2.0_1 -> 2.4.0, ipython 7.18.1 -> 7.24.0, krb5 1.18.2 -> 1.19.1, libxml2 2.9.10_1 -> 2.9.12, libxmlsec1 1.2.30 -> 1.2.32, mysql-client 8.0.21 -> 8.0.25, mysql-connector-c++ 8.0.21 -> 8.0.25, pyenv 1.2.21 -> 2.0.0, python@3.8 3.8.6 -> 3.8.10, python@3.9 3.9.0 -> 3.9.5, sphinx-doc 3.2.1_1 -> 4.0.
...
```

### Upgrade all packages

Update outdated packages. WARNING Use this with caution - it can break Python virtual environments for example.

```sh
$ brew upgrade --dry-run

$ brew upgrade
```

Here is a shortcut I found - from [article](https://medium.com/@kkostov/how-to-install-node-and-npm-on-macos-using-homebrew-708e2c3877bd ).

```sh
alias brewery='brew update && brew upgrade && brew cleanup'
```

### Help

```sh
$ brew upgrade --help
```
```
Upgrade outdated, unpinned formulae using the same options they were originally
installed with, plus any appended brew formula options. If formula are
specified, upgrade only the given formula kegs (unless they are pinned; see
pin, unpin).

Unless HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP is set, brew cleanup will then be run for
the upgraded formulae or, every 30 days, for all formulae.
```


## Remove

```sh
$ brew uninstall PACKAGE
```


## Taps

```sh
$ brew tap <TAP_NAME>/taps
$ brew install <TAP_NAME>
```

e.g.

```sh
$ brew tap isacikgoz/taps
$ brew install gitbatch
```


## Link

You can run `brew link` directly but it also runs as part of install or upgrade.

If a symlink cannot be created, you will get an error message with instructions as below.

To force the link and overwrite all conflicting files:

```sh
brew link --overwrite PACKAGE
```

To list all files that would be deleted:

```sh
$ brew link --overwrite --dry-run PACKAGE
```
  

## Services

Set up a service to start now and then start up whenever you boot the machine. This uses `launchd`.

### Example 

Sample instructions given when installing `dnsmasq`.

To have `launchd` start `dnsmasq` now and restart at startup:

```sh
$ sudo brew services start dnsmasq
```
