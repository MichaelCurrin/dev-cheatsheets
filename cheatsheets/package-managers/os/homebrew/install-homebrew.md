# Install Homebrew

See the [brew.sh](https://brew.sh) homepage.

This will request your password as it needs _root_ permissions.

```sh
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

See [install.sh](https://github.com/Homebrew/install/blob/master/install.sh) on GitHub.

If upgrading Homebrew, it is recommended to then [upgrade all packages](#upgrade-all-packages).
