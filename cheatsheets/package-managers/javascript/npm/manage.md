# Manage NPM

## Install

See [Install Node.js and NPM](https://gist.github.com/MichaelCurrin/aa1fc56419a355972b96bce23f3bccba) gist instructions.


## Update

You should probably update Node.js as a whole but you can update just NPM if you need to. NPM will prompt you to do this sometimes.

```sh
$ npm i -g --update npm
```
