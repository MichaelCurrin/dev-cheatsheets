## To use a registry or not

A developer can publish to an NPM package registry like NPM or GitHub. These require authenticating and using a _publish_ step as part of your deploy workflow.

A package on a registry is easier to search for and browse.

If you don't want go through that hassle for your project and you care more about using your own project than others finding and installing it, there is another much lighter approach. See [GitHub repos as a registry](#github-repos-as-a-registry) section.

The GitHub repo approach makes using code on public repos easy. The downside is that when you install a package from GitHub, you machine will have to download content it might not need and it might have to compile, bundle and minify JS code. Compared to using a package which is already published on NPM as a ready-to-use optimized JS file.

There is also more trust behind a package that is on NPM versus just a repo that only gives the option of installing using GitHub. And if a package is malicious on NPM, the NPM community can have it maintained, while a GitHub repo might be harder to remove. However, just because something is on NPM doesn't make it more secure - they have been security incidents over the years with malicious or insecure packages.

There have also been incidents on both GitHub and NPM where package used bymany products is removed by the owner and is no longer available to download, causing products to break.


## NPM registry

[registry.npmjs.org](https://registry.npmjs.org/)

Help from `npm install -h`:

```
npm install [<@scope>/]<pkg>
npm install [<@scope>/]<pkg>@<tag>
npm install [<@scope>/]<pkg>@<version>
npm install [<@scope>/]<pkg>@<version range>
```

### Download by package name

There are a limited set of unique package names on NPM.

- `registry.npmjs.org/PACKAGE`
- e.g. [registry.npmjs.org/react](https://npm.pkg.github.com/react)

Use as:

```sh
$ npm install PACKAGE
$ # e.g.
$ npm install react
```

### Download by org name and package name

Some packages are published under an organization / username, to show ownership and to make it easy to find all their packages.

- `registry.npmjs.org/@ORG/PACKAGE`
- e.g. [registry.npmjs.org/@vue/cli](https://registry.npmjs.org/@vue/cli)
- e.g. [registry.npmjs.org/@vue/cli-plugin-babel](https://registry.npmjs.org/@vue/cli-plugin-babel)
- e.g. [registry.npmjs.org/@types/lodash](https://registry.npmjs.org/@types/lodash)

Use as:

```sh
$ npm install PACKAGE
$ # e.g.
$ npm install @vue/cli
```

Another reason to use this approach is if you want to publish a fork of a package without conflicting with the original package.

For example, `react` is taken, but you can publish a fork on NPM which people can `@my-user/react`.

```sh
$ npm install @my-user/react
```

### Aliases

You can even set that up with an alias so you can import is as `react` in your app. It's probably better to be more explicit and verbose.

But anyway in can you do want to use the alias, here is how I did it before.

Help from `npm install -h`:

```
...
npm install <alias>@npm:<name>
```

Example:

```sh
$ yarn add vue-markdown@npm:@adapttive/vue-markdown
```

Changes in `package.json`:

```diff
{
  "dependencies": {
    -"vue-markdown": "^2.2.4"
    +"vue-markdown": "npm:@adapttive/vue-markdown@3.0.0-beta.2"
  }
}
```

### Download URL

This is what the download URL looks like for an NPM package.

Install command:

```sh
$ npm install @vue/cli
```

URL for tarball (zip file) which gets downloaded:

- `https://registry.npmjs.org/@vue/cli/-/cli-4.5.11.tgz`

You can find this URL for a package with:

```sh
$ npm view @vue/cli
```
```
@vue/cli@4.5.11 | MIT | deps: 35 | versions: 140
Command line interface for rapid Vue.js development
https://cli.vuejs.org/
...
dist
.tarball: https://registry.npmjs.org/@vue/cli/-/cli-4.5.11.tgz
...
.unpackedSize: 158.9 kB
...
dist-tags:
latest: 4.5.11       next: 5.0.0-alpha.4
```


## GitHub registry

[npm.pkg.github.com](https://npm.pkg.github.com)

Set up a config to tell your NPM command to look at GitHub instead of NPM.

- `.npmrc`
    ```
    registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/@octo-org
    ```

Note:

> By default, you can only use GitHub Packages packages from **one** organization.

See the doc linked below for info on to use multiple orgs.

### Download by package name

- `https://npm.pkg.github.com/PACKAGE`

### Download by org and package name

- `https://npm.pkg.github.com/@ORG/PACKAGE`

Install from GitHub. Make sure you use the owner name in both the URL above and the name below.

```sh
$ npm install @octo-org/octo-app
```

### Install from NPM

With GitHub setup, you can still install from the NPM registry.

```sh
$ npm install @babel/core
$ npm install @lodash  # Matches standard use of installing 'lodash', I think.
```

## GitHub repos as a registry

When to make your NPM package installable from GitHub.

- Avoid the redtape and process of signing up for an NPM account and using `npm publish` and a token.
- For hobby projects that you don't expect others to use or find.
- For installing from `master` / `main` without having to publish a release version first. This makes your own projects easier and also means you can install the absolute latest code on a public GitHub repo before they publish their code to NPM.
- For private projects that only you use or users in your company can install.

Help from running `npm install -h`:

```
...
npm install <git:// url>
npm install <github username>/<github project>
```

### Download from public repo

Given repo `https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME` which has a `package.json` at the root.

```sh
$ npm install https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME@COMMIT_REF
```

e.g. Install from `master` branch.

```sh
$ npm install https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli
$ npm install https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli#develop
```

### Download from private repo

Assuming you have your SSH keys set up locally and on GitHub, for access to private repos.

```sh
$ npm install git+ssh://git@github.com:USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
```

This does something like this internally:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
```


### CDN

On the browser side, you'll probably want to download a JS file or other asset from a CDN, rather than NPM.

See my [CDNs](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/dev-resources/resources/javascript/cdns.html) guide.
