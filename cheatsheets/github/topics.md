## Icons

An easy way to get an icon for a language or library without downloading and searching to use the values supported by GitHub.

This was based on the config section of [github/personal-website](https://github.com/github/personal-website) repo but can also be seen by inspecting an image on a topic page.


### Approach

Replace `TOPIC` with your value - not all topics are available but you can use some common ones. 

The ID in the middle of the URL is constant.
