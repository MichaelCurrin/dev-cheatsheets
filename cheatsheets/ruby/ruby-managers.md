# Ruby managers

Install Ruby with an environment manager.

You might prefer to use Ruby environment managers like:

- [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) - see [blog post](https://richstone.io/where-is-ruby-3-0-0-on-rbenv/)
- [rvm](https://rvm.io/)

```sh
$ rbenv install 3.0.0

$ rvm install 3.0
$ rvm use 3.0
```

I've never used them as I've never had to.

If your Linux distro doesn't support Ruby 3 yet, you might have to use one of the above.
