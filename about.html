            <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

<p>This project is a reference for code snippets and shell commands across programming languages. It contains a way doing things based on previous or expected use-cases which highly relevant for me. It serves as a cache of sorts - I look in my cheatsheets for syntax or approach to a use-case first and then add Google, StackOverflow, documentation, etc. And when I find the answer I add it here so next time my search will be quicker and I’ll find the same answer each time.</p>

<p>This guide is not aimed at teaching fundamentals of a language or explaining things to beginners - it assumes context. It aims to be lean and easy to navigate with a focus on code over explanations for compactness, but sometimes it still explains how or why to use a snippet.</p>

<p>There are plenty of tutorials and cheatsheets out there. This one is unique (for my at least) as it only contains topic and code that I have actually used before or plan to use, so it’s a reference of what I know (or once knew). A cheatsheet made by someone is not personal to me and might have things I don’t need or in a layout I don’t like.</p>

<p>I do link to other cheatsheets in some cases here, but when I have time I like to bring in a few items to my own guide, since external sites will not always be around as pages or domains.</p>

<h2 id="why-use-dev-cheatsheets">Why use Dev Cheatsheets?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>You want a short <strong>reference</strong> (ideally one-page) for a tool or library, because you know the context and just need the syntax and an example.</li>
  <li>You’re thinking of that that <strong>command</strong>, <strong>argument</strong> or <strong>function</strong> you used before in <strong>JS</strong> or <strong>Python</strong> or <strong>Jekyll</strong>, but you just can’t remember exactly what it does, or how to use it.</li>
  <li>You want a reference of the most commonly used <strong>CLI</strong> commands (for NPM or Bash), what they mean and some real world examples.</li>
  <li>You don’t want to sift through the entire online docs or the manpage which can be long and formal, or tutorials or blog posts which can be verbose paragraphs and tell you mostly what you already know.</li>
</ul>

<!-- NOTES

## Ramblings

I add code here if I find I use it more than once, from other cheatsheets, StackOverflow or my own creation. There may be links, but the idea is to be explicit here to avoid clicking through and also the risk of external content moving/disappearing.

The idea is to have boilerplate and templates which I already I understand and can use as a reference. This is not aimed at learning the language or concept for the first time.

The code here might not actually run, especially templates.

I am likely going to copy-paste the things in here often. Just to make typing it that much easier and to save a Stack Overflow search for an item I found before.

I might memorize the items, or just type them out enough times that I know them, but I keep as a cheatsheet for long term use.

There are also hacks which are not necessarily useful to someone learning the language but something I use.

There might also be links to cheatsheets I've found. I might take an existing cheatsheet and cut it down to the stuff I don't know so well yet but am likely to need.

The idea is to keep this project as a lean as possible. Wider details on learning or using a language are covered in my other projects.

There may be missing context or explanations and obvious things are excluded. As the cheatsheet is intended for myself mainly.
